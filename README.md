# clburlisonâ€™s dotfiles

## Installation

### Using Git and the bootstrap script

You can clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it in `~/src/mine/dotfiles`.) The bootstrapper script will pull in the latest version and copy the files to your home folder. Make sure any confiuration files that you do not want public on the internet are controled under .gitingore for this repo. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clburlison/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && source bootstrap.sh
```

To update, `cd` into your local `dotfiles` repository and then:

```bash
source bootstrap.sh
```
