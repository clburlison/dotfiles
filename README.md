# clburlisonâ€™s dotfiles

These are my dotfiles.

I now use [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup) to store my configurations between machines including these dotfiles. I will continue to keep this repo updated for reference purposes in case anyone wants to take a look.


# Mackup usage steps
These are mostly for Clayton's memory...
* Install Dropbox
* Install python3 (currently Mackup has a py2 incompatibility issue).
* `pip3 install --upgrade mackup --user`
* `~/Library/Python/3.6/bin/mackup restore`

And then you change your shell to zsh or fish

		chsh -s `which zsh`
		chsh -s /usr/local/bin/fish

Eventually `osx_defaults.sh` will get replaced with chef or puppet config....some day.
